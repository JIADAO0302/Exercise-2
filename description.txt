This file describes the components of this submission for Exercise 2 (DS5105).

-----------------------------
Question 1 – ATE Estimation
-----------------------------
- The regression model was estimated using Python and statsmodels.
- The estimated average treatment effect (ATE) is approximately -9.11.
- Interpretation: Participation in the carbon offset program is associated with a 9.11-point *decrease* in engagement score, after controlling for sustainability spending.

Answers:
Q1.2) The ATE estimate (τ̂) is -9.11, meaning treated units scored lower in engagement.
Q1.3) This estimate is causal if:
   - The model is correctly specified (linearity, no omitted variables),
   - Treatment is unconfounded (no unmeasured confounders),
   - Observations are independent.

-----------------------------
Question 2 – Flask API & Docker
-----------------------------
- app.py: Flask app that exposes a POST endpoint '/predict'.
- It accepts treatment and sustainability_spending as inputs and returns the predicted engagement score.
- The model is not re-trained; coefficients are hardcoded from Part 1 results.

- requirements.txt: Lists Python package dependencies (Flask).
- Dockerfile: Builds the containerized app using python:3.10-slim and exposes port 5000.

Q2.3) When Wi = 1 and Xi = 20, the predicted score is:
      Ŷ = 141.58 + (-9.11)*1 + (-0.46)*20 ≈ 122.58
